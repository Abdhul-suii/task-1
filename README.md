Tell me about your website here.
This website is all about Marvel Comics Collections, where you can find all the Marvel comics easily. I made categories for each hero , so when you click a button (like spider man), it takes you to spider man's comic collections. Right now, We only have Iron man, Spider,Thor, and Captain America,But more will be added soon! 

There's also a Search bar, so you can search any Marvel comic, and it will take you to the collection for that comic but without the javascript it wont work it wont take what you want for now and the search bar is not functional for now
